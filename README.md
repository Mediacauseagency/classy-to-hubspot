# Classy to HubSpot

A `node` intermediary between the Classy and HubSpot APIs.

Getting started:
- `npm install`

Running tests:
- `npm run test` will run test in `test/index.js`
- `npm run lint` will lint your code based on the [standard JS style](https://standardjs.com/) and will fix it where possible
- `npm run check` will run a dependecy check
- you can run `npm run test-all` to run all of the above

*Make sure that `npm run test-all` passes before commiting.*
