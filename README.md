A `node` intermediary between the Classy and HubSpot APIs.

### Getting started
1. Install the packages: `npm install`.
2. Get the API keys and add them to a `.env` file in the project's root directory.

### Running tests
- `npm run test` will run tests in `test/index.js`
- `npm run lint` will lint your code based on the [standard JS](https://standardjs.com/) and make fixes where possible
- `npm run check` will run a dependency check
- you can run `npm run test-all` to run all of the above

#### *Make sure that `npm run test-all` passes before commiting.*
